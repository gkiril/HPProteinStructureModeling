Protein-Structure-Prediction
============================

The software is written in Java, last modified on June 2011.

Development of software for 2D/3D HP â€“ folding visualization of proteins. When the user inputs the value of a protein (the HP value), the software produces .lp file (which is a linear model) for the optimization software IBM CPLEX. CPLEX reads the file and returns a result. The user enters the result in this software, and the software visualizes the protein (in 2D or 3D, depending on the wish of the user). The languages, technologies and software used are: Java SE, NetBeans, IBM CPLEX, Notepad++.

The interface is written on Bulgarian language.
